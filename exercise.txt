Here is a 3-hour practical exam that tests your knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, covering the topics you provided:

*Task:*

Create a simple To-Do List application that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. The application should have the following features:

1. A text input field to add new tasks
2. A button to add tasks to the list
3. A list element to display tasks
4. A button to remove tasks from the list

*Requirements:*

1. Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the application
2. Use the `prompt()` function to get user input for new tasks
3. Use the `alert()` function to display messages to the user
4. Use booleans to keep track of task completion status
5. Use the `.checked` property to toggle task completion
6. Use a `for` loop to iterate over the task list
7. Use `if` statements to handle user input and task status
8. Use logical operators to combine conditions
9. Use assignment operators to update task status
10. Use string methods to manipulate task text
11. Use method chaining to concatenate string methods
12. Use the `padStart()` method to format task numbers
13. Use the `slice()` method to extract task text
14. Use variable scope to manage global and local variables

*Constraints:*

1. Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries)
2. Write clean, readable, and well-structured code
3. Test your code in a browser to ensure it works as expected

*Grading Criteria:*

1. Functionality (40 points)
2. Code quality and structure (30 points)
3. User experience and design (30 points)

*Time Limit:* 3 hours

Good luck!!
